Plugins for Tiles.

## Obsidian

Search, read, and organize an Obsidian vault from Tiles using the official Obsidian CLI.

- [Plugin source](./obsidian/)
- [Agent skill](./obsidian/skills/obsidian/SKILL.md)
- [Download ZIP](https://github.com/tilesprivacy/plugins/raw/refs/heads/main/obsidian.zip)
- [Obsidian CLI setup](https://obsidian.md/cli)

Install the plugin:

```sh
tiles plugin install https://github.com/tilesprivacy/plugins/raw/refs/heads/main/obsidian.zip
```

Restart Tiles after installation, then ask, for example:

```text
@obsidian Find my notes about Project Atlas and summarize the open questions.
```

Install a current Obsidian desktop installer, enable **Settings → General → Command line interface**, and register `obsidian` on your PATH. The CLI connects to the desktop app, which must be running. This package supplies agent instructions, not Obsidian or an MCP server.

The ZIP follows [Agent Plugins 1.0.0](https://agent-plugins.org/): `plugin.json`, `LICENSE`, and `skills/obsidian/SKILL.md` are at the archive root. To rebuild it from this repository:

```sh
cd obsidian
zip -r ../obsidian.zip plugin.json LICENSE skills
```
